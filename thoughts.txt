ideally to create a line,

1. a checkbox to begin creating a line commences
2. user clicks on start of line (at a station marker) - need to define what a "station marker" is
3. and polygon forms based on places user clicks on
4. until user clicks on final station marker
5. then unchecks creating a line checkbox
6. line is fully created
