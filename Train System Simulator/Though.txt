connection? a class containing detail of a transfer between tracksections (or single track section) allowing trains to move from one track to another

Calculating if a train will end up on the same track position as another train

line? best to have indepentant tracks for when lines merge
WHY? The reason is due to the complex nature of determining at what point will 2 trains occupy the same real estate at the same time.
Event this way, we need to be careful about parrallel tracks. 
The co-orditinates will be at such a point that confusion in the code regarding positions of trains will become rampant
